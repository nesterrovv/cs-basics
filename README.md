# Basics of computer science

## Short description:
My implimentation of CS basics course at the ITMO University, 1st year of styd–Ωing. The course is supposed to be introductory to the specialty, 
in the documents it sounds like "Fundamentals of professional activity". In practice, it implies familiarity with computers at a low level: 
the processor device and its registers, the organization of calculations and work with memory, the clock-by-cycle execution of commands 
similar to assembly codes, and so on. As part of the course, several laboratory works are expected to be performed, reports 
on which will be published here. It is also planned to publish sources that help to master the subject, as well as my notes on the course.

## Laboratory work #2. Study of the work of the computer.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of the work is to study the methods of work on the base computer and the study
order of execution of arithmetic instructions and transfer instructions.

**Task:**

According to the variant given by the teacher, determine the function,
calculated by the program, the representation area and the range of valid values
source data and result, trace the program, suggest
variant with fewer commands. Present the results while doing the work.
and all operands of arithmetic operations are signed numbers, and logical
operations by a set of sixteen logical values.

**Preparing for work:**

Get to know the device and system
commands of the base computer (see Appendix B, paragraphs 1.1 - 1.6), the order of execution
machine commands (clause 1.9), instructions for working with the base computer model (see
appendix D). To study the representations in the computer of numerical and logical values.

**Work order:**

Restore the text of the given variant
program, separate data cells from program code, write assignment
program and the implemented function, which is represented as a formula.

During admission to work, obtain from the teacher the initial data for
variables, agree on a version of the program for execution, memorize
base computer a given version of the program and, executing it by command, fill
trace table of the executed program. Entering the program with data, and
also demonstrate the launch of the program in remote mode to the teacher.

## Laboratory work #3. Execution of cyclic programs.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of the work is to study ways to organize cyclic programs and
study of the order of operation of the computer when performing cyclic
programs and processing of one-dimensional arrays

**Task:**

According to the variant given by the teacher, restore the text
a given version of the program, determine the purpose and write a description
program, determine the scope of the presentation and the range of valid values
source data and result, trace the program.

**Preparing for work:**

Obtain the variant number and initial data from the teacher
laboratory work. To study the ways and means of organizing cyclic
programs using the command system of the base computer (Appendix B, clause 1.7).
Restore the text of the specified version of the program. Write a description of the program.

**Work order:**

Obtain the variant number and initial data from the teacher
laboratory work. To study the ways and means of organizing cyclic
programs using the command system of the base computer (Appendix B, clause 1.7).
Restore the text of the specified version of the program. Write a description of the program.
